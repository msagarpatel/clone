This script is basically a poor man's
[SuperDuper!](https://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html)
â€“ it copies non-system files from the host to a target disk, and makes
the target disk bootable. Thus, this script creates a bootable clone of
the host.

I created this at a time when I didn't want to purchase SuperDuper, but
for several reasons I finally relented, and bought a license.

This project is no longer actively maintained, and the script probably
does not work with a recent version of macOS.
